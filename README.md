## How to Use

### Hardware Setup

1. Ensure the MMA7660 accelerometer is correctly connected to the mbed board:
   - Connect SDA to pin p28 on the mbed
   - Connect SCL to pin p27 on the mbed
   - Connect VCC to 3.3V
   - Connect GND to ground

2. If using an external LCD, ensure it's properly connected according to the C12832 specifications
   (Note: Many mbed application boards already include this LCD)

### Running the Program

1. Connect your mbed LPC1768 board to your computer via USB
2. Drag and drop the compiled .bin file onto the mbed drive that appears
3. Disconnect from USB if using battery power, or keep connected for USB power
4. The program will start automatically after the file transfer completes

### Operation Instructions

1. **Calibration Phase**:
   - When first powered on, the device will enter calibration mode for 3 seconds
   - The LCD will display "Calibrating..." with a progress bar
   - Keep the device stationary during this phase to establish a proper baseline
   - LED3 will be off during calibration

2. **Ready Phase**:
   - After calibration completes, the LCD will show "Ready - Start walking"
   - LED3 will illuminate to indicate the device is ready
   - The device is now prepared to detect steps

3. **Active Phase**:
   - Begin walking normally while holding or wearing the device
   - The LCD will update in real-time with:
     - Current step count
     - Step intensity measurement
   - LED2 will flash with each detected step
   - For optimal results, maintain the same orientation as during calibration

4. **Reset/Recalibrate**:
   - To reset the step counter or recalibrate, press the reset button on the mbed board
   - The device will restart and enter calibration mode again

## Step Detection Algorithm

The system employs a sophisticated multi-stage algorithm to accurately detect steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Raw accelerometer data is collected from the MMA7660 at 50Hz (20ms intervals)
   - The 3-axis (X, Y, Z) acceleration values are read via I²C interface

2. **Signal Processing**:
   - A magnitude vector is calculated from the X, Y, and Z acceleration components
   - The gravity baseline (established during calibration) is subtracted
   - A moving average filter with a window size of 20 samples reduces noise

3. **Primary Step Detection**:
   - A state machine analyzes the processed acceleration signal
   - Steps are detected by identifying characteristic peaks and valleys
   - Thresholds adapt based on previous step intensity

4. **Secondary Detection**:
   - A jerk-based detection algorithm (rate of change of acceleration) acts as a backup system
   - This helps detect steps that might be missed by the primary detector

5. **Validation Logic**:
   - Timing constraints prevent false counting (minimum 0.25s between steps)
   - Peak analysis confirms step patterns match typical walking motion
   - Adaptive thresholds adjust to the user's walking style

## Algorithm Description

The step detection system in Navigo uses a multi-stage process to accurately identify steps from accelerometer data:

### 1. Calibration Phase
- Device measures acceleration magnitude (√(x²+y²+z²)) over 3 seconds while stationary
- These readings are averaged to establish the baseline gravity magnitude
- This baseline is subtracted from all future readings to isolate user movement

### 2. Signal Processing
- Raw acceleration magnitude has baseline gravity subtracted
- Exponential smoothing is applied using the formula:
  ```
  smoothAccel = α × rawAccel + (1-α) × smoothAccel
  ```
  where α = 0.2, providing responsive yet stable measurements

### 3. Step Detection State Machine
The algorithm uses a two-state machine to detect the characteristic acceleration pattern during a step:

- **Rising Edge Detection (State: Not In Step)**
  - Waits for smoothed acceleration to exceed the threshold (initially 0.20)
  - Ensures minimum 0.5s has passed since the last step
  - When conditions are met, enters "In Step" state and begins tracking the peak

- **Peak Tracking & Falling Edge Detection (State: In Step)**
  - Continuously updates the peak acceleration value during the step
  - Detects step completion when acceleration falls below 70% of the measured peak
  - Requires minimum time (0.5s) to have passed to avoid false positives
  - Increments step counter when a complete step cycle is detected
  - Includes a 2.0s timeout to reset if the step pattern isn't completed

### 4. Adaptive Threshold Adjustment
- After each detected step, the threshold is recalculated:
  ```
  newThreshold = min(peakValue × 0.4, 0.35)
  stepThreshold = max(0.20, newThreshold)
  ```
- This allows the system to adapt to different walking intensities while maintaining stability

### 5. Anti-Bounce Protection
- 0.3 second delay after each step to prevent double-counting
- LED provides visual feedback for each detected step

The system samples at 100Hz (every 0.01 seconds) to maintain responsive performance while conserving power.

## Performance Optimization

The algorithm has been fine-tuned for optimal performance with the following considerations:

- **Sampling Rate**: 50Hz provides sufficient temporal resolution while maintaining low power consumption
- **Filter Settings**: 20-sample window offers good noise reduction without excessive lag
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Self-adjusting thresholds improve accuracy across different walking styles
- **Dual Detection Methods**: Primary and secondary detection algorithms work together for reliability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **No Display on LCD**:
  - Check power supply connections
  - Verify LCD connections if using external display
  - Ensure the binary was successfully transferred to the mbed

- **LED4 (Error LED) is On**:
  - This indicates an accelerometer connection issue
  - Check I²C connections to pins p28 (SDA) and p27 (SCL)
  - Verify accelerometer power connections
  - Try resetting the device

- **Inaccurate Step Count (Over-counting)**:
  - Hold the device more firmly to reduce vibration
  - Try recalibrating on a flat, stable surface
  - Consider adjusting the placement (waist level typically works best)

- **Inaccurate Step Count (Under-counting)**:
  - Ensure consistent device orientation while walking
  - Try placing the device in a more rigid container
  - For very light walking, ensure the device is firmly attached to the body

- **Inconsistent Performance**:
  - Check battery voltage if using external power
  - Temperature extremes can affect accelerometer sensitivity
  - Recalibrate if moving between significantly different environments

### Debugging

For advanced debugging, the following modifications can be made to main.cpp:

1. Add Serial communication to view raw accelerometer data:
   ```cpp
   Serial pc(USBTX, USBRX);
   // Then in the main loop:
   pc.printf("X: %.2f, Y: %.2f, Z: %.2f, Mag: %.2f\n", ax, ay, az, accel);
   ```

2. Export data for analysis:
   ```cpp
   // In the main loop:
   pc.printf("%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%d\n", ax, ay, az, filteredAccel, inStep ? 1 : 0);
   ```
   This can be captured and plotted in tools like MATLAB or Excel.
